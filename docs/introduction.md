# Introduction

## Folder structure

Our SDK has the main objective to expose our data structures that are the business objects of our application: we call them `Entities` and thet are included in a package with the same name.

```bash
-- src
   |- igenius_adapters_sdk
      |- entities
```

## Data structure

Our datasource adapters system is based on a relational database structure, so our `entities` are a mapping of this kind of data organisation.
